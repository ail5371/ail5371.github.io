I graduated from my university with a degree in Toxicology back in December of 2017 where I then moved to Dallas, Texas. I thought I had found this amazing job right before I graduated but I was horribly wrong. The job entailed sitting in an open space with about 40 other individuals where we cold called millionaires. I had to travel every morning and every evening in bumper to bumper traffic on the toll road. So not only was I in traffic for about an hour each way but I also had to pay to be in traffic. As much as I wanted to endure it, it was one of those situations where I needed to get out despartely. 

I started a new job as a business development associate. I never thought I would be in the automotive industry but there I was. I was in the job for about 7 months where I continuously looked for other jobs. The job was great in that it gave me flexibility but the job gave me no value or challenge. Luckily, my job had just hired a new service director and he came forward and asked if I wanted to be a service advisor. I immediately said yes as I was already looking into the position but was told I needed to wait a year by the previous director. I absolutely love my job now but I want to continue to be better. 

Technology is constantly around us and it is only smart to expand with it. Coding is different and will only open doors for me. These past few months have been busy and I haven't had the opportunity to really learn as the job was new and I needed to put the time into it but now that things have settled down. I am ready to get started!
